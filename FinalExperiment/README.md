Unethical behaviors such as dishonesty, cheating, and corruption happen frequently at an 
individual level as well as at an organizational level. Recent Experimental evidence suggests 
that there is stronger inclination to behave immorally in organisations. We investigated
individual behaviour within groups under two punishment mechanisms. The first punishment 
mechanism penalizes the individual solely whereas the second penalizes the group collectively. 
Our findings suggest that there are no significant differences in behaviour under individual 
punishment mechanisms, nor under group punishment mechanisms.
