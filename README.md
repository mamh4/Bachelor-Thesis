For my bachelor thesis I programmed an Economic Experiment for TUM's Professorship of Economics. The experiment can be conceptualized as a two-player game, wherein each participant views a video and subsequently communicates their observations. The rewards or payoffs for each participant are determined based on the treatment group to which they are assigned. You can find below the experiment's implementation.

To run the experiment on your local machine (http://localhost:8000/) you'd need to install the python framework 'otree' then navigate to the experiment directory using the terminal and execute the command "otree devserver".

## Treatment Group Instructions
The instructions are explained on this page followed by a quiz to assess the player's understanding of the experiment.

Players are not allowed to procceed until they've answered all the quiz questions correctly. Players' number of false entries for each question is recorded.

## Video Page
The players then proceed to a time-out page that lasts 10 seconds showing a video of series coin tosses.

## Questionnaire Page
The player is then presented with a few questions one of which states what the outcome of the video the player watched was and what they reported and asks them of the reasoning behind their choice whether being honest or lying.

## (potential) Waiting Page
Incase the player's team-mate has still not completed the experiment upto the reporting page the payoff cannot be yet determined. The player is then procceeded to a waiting page until their team-mate is done.
